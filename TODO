- make mobile-friendly
  - fixed header looks wrong
  - default graph width is too wide
  - filter bars have too many spaces
  - make top header disappear on scroll (decide if thats ONLY on mobile)
  - investigate a more elegant way of hiding filters while viewing graph.
- in chart tooltips, show full date, and time of data collection for each day
- add other countries
- add horizontal lines showing major events for areas: governor announcements, testing centers open, etc
- optional overlay of dots on map: cities, testing centers
- try out windowing functions, maybe just 48 hours. (trying to solve jaggedy lines)
- add optional rolling average lines to chart
- add animated playback of cases on map
- let user drill down from globe -> country -> state -> county on map
- incorporate age data where found
- incorporate illness onset data where found
- pass along covid tracking data quality grades to user
- for covidtracking data, also show links to sites for data
- display age of data onscreen (minutes/hours since last poll)
- display last update time for each area
- distinguish between positive and presumptive positive, if possible
- confirm that my aggregate country #s matches the Covidtracking /us/daily #s
- atleast add italy as another country using salute.it data
- for regions, show which states are in the region
- when switching filters, there is a long delay before the user is given feedback. do something. 
- can/should we vary the width of the positive %age line depending on how accurate the %age is according to test count?
- show doubling rate; not sure how best to calculate that.
- investigate desirable behavior for storing filter settings in localstorage
- add city locations on maps
- incorporate ALL jh daily data, then show graphs for individual counties
- switching from USA map to state map should keep filters same as much as possible
- add IFR estimate, if possible
- dont have population data for the territories... minor issue atm.
- our cfr is not correct, its not based off recoveries. is there a better term for that?
- daily charts on charts page display pending, which may blow the domainMax, since we calculate it from max of total.
- bug: recharts has uneven ticks on both axes
- no longer fixed header, and header padding wrong, after adding react-router
- confirm all the withPlaces helpers are rounding off? thought some weren't
- confirm my "total squared per 1m" is statistically legitimate, or replace with whatever is best practice
- confirm i should be using per-1m not per-100k. i've seen elsewhere that per-100k may be more standard for low events?
- mouseover on map is triggering an entire render() for StateMap and UsaMap... can i stop this?
- the state maps can be better rotated/projected, just not sure how. they are too curved as is.
- for the country also see if we can use a flat USA projection, like google maps
- truly address the NYC problem
- decide on if "confirmed" is the correct terminology rather than "positive"?
- bug: alaska state display is broken
- for SOME fields in ct data i am making turning null's into 0s. stop doing that (make sure it breaks nothing)
- what does it mean when counties are absent from JH data? does it mean they are 0 or unknown?
- styling: i want the state name to always be always centered over the stats on the state page, but the table to take up all the room to the left and right
- styling: make state page stats a true table so word wrap takes place only on its side of the stats
- styling: charts should always take up entire width until a breakpoint, and then multiple charts can exist horizontally
- bug: scale matching broke for ChartsPage with total basis
- add hospital data to areamodel! vents, icu beds, doctors, hospitals, utilization... that would be cool
- add banner ability to top header
- i need date reported of each number, then i can average the entries values based on when the date
- is "recovered" all recovered, even mild cases, or only discharged hospitalizations?
- bug: on USAMap, if you're looking at the county view, you can choose # test and total hospitalized, neither of which have data at the county level
- bug: dumb filter {cursor: pointer} doesn't trigger while in the padding of an unchosen option in chrome
- bug: selected filters look different between safari and chrome (i actually like the unintended safari version)
- bug: some regions not displaying correctly after pipeline
- states.json
  - have the page poll for updated states.json
  - states.json needs to be served gzipped
  - how do i make really really sure chrome does it cache it at all ever?
  - add reporting so if script is breaking i know, and for warnings
  - for each run save the output files (and possible the source files?) to s3
  - heroku uses 12.16.1 node! so i should prolly use that locally unless i can upgrae?

REFACTOR
- switch to graphql interface
- investigate other chloropleth packages, including google-map-react, http://polymaps.org/
- consider redux-orm
- decide where CensusStore goes now
- rename remaining "entries" variables to "series"
- remove all the renaming in decorateTimeSeries! or just properly map fields in actions.js
- use a proper time series library... pondjs? ts.js, zodiac-ts
- is FIPS still the code i should be using? seems deprecated
- use route helpers if react-router has them? in map click handlers
- fix the damned sourcemaps
- get page to set body (or .app) classname like in ember
- submit bugfix to react-simple-maps to render *all* objects, not only the first GeometryCollection
- AreaModel#totals should just be the last entries, slightly decorated.
- ideally neighborNumbers shouldn't return numbers it was given.
- CT's 'total' field is deprecated and will be removed. calc myself if needed
- record s3 bucket policy and cors should i need to rebuild... terraform?
