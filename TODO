DATASET / DATA FEED FIXES
- when a CT current frame is diff than last daily frame, is that current frame possibly going to update again before its set? i.e. is the current frame reported possibly a partial count, not a full 24h period?
- you always have a current day after 4pm, so if the state updates after then, another frame is added for a day possibly in the FUTURE. does that make sense?
- WHAT DOES IT MEAN when counties are absent from JH data? does it mean they are 0 or unknown? atm showing nulls as 0s on the map
- is "recovered" all recovered, even mild cases, or only discharged hospitalizations?
- i need date reported of each state, then i can average the entries values based on when the date
- dont have population data for the territories... minor issue atm.
- understand what CT dateChecked/dateModified is and add it into our Series model
- understand what JH's last_update means and add it
- add JH other country data
- distinguish between positive and presumptive positive, if possible
- atleast add italy as another country using salute.it data
- specifics
  - CA: fix older death/positives #s using public.tableau.com link...
  - CO: glitch on mar30-mar31... how to fix?
  - NV: http://www.covidgohome.com/states/NV - somehow there is a # of tests less than 0?
  - MI: http://www.covidgohome.com/states/MI - over 100% positive tests somehow on one day?
  - CT: apr 8 missing?
- confirm that my aggregate country #s matches the Covidtracking /us/daily #s
- add OMB PSA definitions for: MSAs, ÂµSAs, CSAs, CBSAs
- add state age data where found
- add illness onset data where found

IMPROVE DATA ANALYSIS
- show doubling rate; not sure how best to calculate that.
- add city locations on maps
- add IFR estimate, if possible
- our cfr is not correct, its not based off recoveries. is there a better term for that?
- add display of large MSAs, maybe top... 30?
- in chart tooltips, show full date, and time of data collection for each day
- optional overlay of dots on map: cities, testing centers
- add optional rolling average lines to chart
- display age of data onscreen (minutes/hours since last poll)
- display last update time for each area
- confirm my "total squared per 1m" is statistically legitimate, or replace with whatever is best practice
- decide on if "confirmed" is the correct terminology rather than "positive"?
- smoothing probably shouldnt change ydomain... it is misleading.
- add legend to maps!
- pass along covid tracking data quality grades to user
- for covidtracking data, also show links to sites for data
- add other countries
- add horizontal lines showing major events for areas: governor announcements, testing centers open, etc
- can/should we vary the width of the positive %age line depending on how accurate the %age is according to test count?
- confirm i should be using per-1m not per-100k. i've seen elsewhere that per-100k may be more standard for low events?

- make mobile-friendly
  - fixed header looks wrong
  - default graph width is too wide
  - filter bars have too many spaces
  - make top header disappear on scroll (decide if thats ONLY on mobile)
  - investigate a more elegant way of hiding filters while viewing graph.
- add animated playback of cases on map
- let user drill down from globe -> country -> state -> county on map
- when switching filters, there is a long delay before the user is given feedback. do something. 
- investigate desirable behavior for storing filter settings in localstorage
- switching from USA map to state map should keep filters same as much as possible
- no longer fixed header, and header padding wrong, after adding react-router
- confirm all the withPlaces helpers are rounding off? thought some weren't
- the state maps can be better rotated/projected, just not sure how. they are too curved as is.
- for the country also see if we can use a flat USA projection, like google maps
- truly address the NYC problem
- styling: i want the state name to always be always centered over the stats on the state page, but the table to take up all the room to the left and right
- styling: make state page stats a true table so word wrap takes place only on its side of the stats
- styling: charts should always take up entire width until a breakpoint, and then multiple charts can exist horizontally
- counties.json / states.json
  - have the page poll for updated states.json atleast
  - states.json needs to be served gzipped, counties MUST BE or its too big.
  - how do i make really really sure chrome does it cache it at all ever?
  - add reporting so if script is breaking i know, and for warnings
  - for each run save the output files (and possible the source files?) to s3
  - heroku uses 12.16.1 node! so i should prolly use that locally unless i can upgrae?
  - make sure density is saved as number not string
- add banner ability to top header
- for dateslider, consider having the width be determined by the number of days. 
- speed: are county topologies being gzipped?
- speed: minimize material ui bundle size: https://material-ui.com/guides/minimizing-bundle-size/
- speed: mouseover on map is triggering an entire render() for StateMap and UsaMap... can i stop this?
- bug: alaska state display is broken
- bug: scale matching broke for ChartsPage with total basis
- bug: on USAMap, if you're looking at the county view, you can choose # test and total hospitalized, neither of which have data at the county level
- bug: filter {cursor: pointer} style doesn't trigger while in the padding of an unchosen option in chrome
- bug: selected filters look different between safari and chrome (i actually like the unintended safari version)
- bug: fix ydomain scale matching
- bug: add back squared-per-1m
- bug: average() smoothing smoothing nulls values! and gives them value!
- bug: statepage dropdown: remove blue outline; when selected remove placeholder text
- bug: if you go to states/<unknown code> it just says loading forever
- bug: recharts has uneven ticks on both axes
- bug: state dropdown can select territories that break the page
- bug: prevent dateslider pop-in... i hate page reflows
- bug: show a reasonable slider if DateSlider only spanning one day

REFACTOR
- unite the maps, or split into one that shows counties and one that doesn't.
- introduce administration level into terminology (admin=1 is country, admin=2 is state, admin=3 is county, etc.)
- switch to graphql interface
- USAMap should use topologies
- investigate other chloropleth packages, including google-map-react, http://polymaps.org/
- consider redux-orm
- decide where CensusStore goes now
- use a proper time series library... pondjs? ts.js, zodiac-ts
- use route helpers if react-router has them, in all the history.push's in map handlers
- fix the damned sourcemaps
- get page to set body (or .app) classname like in ember
- submit bugfix to react-simple-maps to render *all* objects, not only the first GeometryCollection
- ideally neighborNumbers shouldn't return numbers it was given.
- record s3 bucket policy and cors should i need to rebuild... terraform?
- reduce us_county_census.json fields
- consider reorganizing county json to reduce space. sequences? positives: [1,4,5,20,34,55,56].. etc
- move PM files to wiki
- simply connect heroku to github
