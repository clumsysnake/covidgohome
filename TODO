- make mobile-friendly
  - fixed header looks wrong
  - default graph width is too wide
  - filter bars have too many spaces
  - make top header disappear on scroll (decide if thats ONLY on mobile)
  - investigate a more elegant way of hiding filters while viewing graph.
- bug: daily charts display pending, which may blow the domainMax, since we calculate it from max of total.
- bug: ny data has some deltas <0, blowing the domainMin. why is that even happening?
- in tooltips, add time of data collection for each day
- add attack rate (requiring population data)
- incorporate latest intraday data, not just the last states/daily, which can be a day old for some
- add log/linear toggle
- add county-level data access for america
- add other countries
- add individual page for each area with maximum data
- add horizontal lines showing major events for areas
  - governor announcements
  - testing centers open
  - other?
- solve the problem of jaggedy graphs. try out windowing functions, maybe just 48 hours.
- add choropleth map with filters
- add animated playback of cases on map
- let user drill down from globe -> country -> state -> county on map
- let user go to specific area page from map
- incorporate age data where found
- incorporate illness onset data where found
- pass along covid tracking data quality grades to user
- for covidtracking data, also show links to sites for data
- switch to graphql interface
- use real data layer library, and move fetching out of component
- thinking about adding some kind of json cache
- poll for updated data
- display age of data onscreen (minutes/hours since last poll)
- display last update time for each area
- distinguish between positive and presumptive positive, if possible
- confirm that my aggregate country #s matches the Covidtracking /us/daily #s
- is the hospitalized line misleading? is it cumulative or current?
- atleast add italy as another country using salute.it data
- use react router for useful urls
- for regions, show which states are in the region
- when switching filters, there is a long delay before the user is given feedback. do something. 
- can/should we vary the width of the positive %age line depending on how accurate the %age is according to test count?
