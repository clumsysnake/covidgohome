- make mobile-friendly
  - fixed header looks wrong
  - default graph width is too wide
  - filter bars have too many spaces
  - make top header disappear on scroll (decide if thats ONLY on mobile)
  - investigate a more elegant way of hiding filters while viewing graph.
- in chart tooltips, show full date, and time of data collection for each day
- incorporate latest intraday data, not just the last states/daily, which can be a day old for some
- add charts log/linear toggle
- add other countries
- add horizontal lines showing major events for areas: governor announcements, testing centers open, etc
- optional overlay of dots on map: cities, testing centers
- try out windowing functions, maybe just 48 hours. (trying to solve jaggedy lines)
- add optional rolling average lines to chart
- add animated playback of cases on map
- let user drill down from globe -> country -> state -> county on map
- incorporate age data where found
- incorporate illness onset data where found
- pass along covid tracking data quality grades to user
- for covidtracking data, also show links to sites for data
- poll for updated data
- display age of data onscreen (minutes/hours since last poll)
- display last update time for each area
- distinguish between positive and presumptive positive, if possible
- confirm that my aggregate country #s matches the Covidtracking /us/daily #s
- atleast add italy as another country using salute.it data
- for regions, show which states are in the region
- when switching filters, there is a long delay before the user is given feedback. do something. 
- can/should we vary the width of the positive %age line depending on how accurate the %age is according to test count?
- show resolved vs active where possible
- show doubling rate; not sure how best to calculate that.
- investigate desirable behavior for storing filter settings in localstorage
- add city locations on maps
- incorporate ALL jh daily data, then show graphs for individual counties

IMPROVE
- on statepage, get chart widths to align.
- dont have population data for the territories... glossing over that for now since they also dont have much data
- our cfr is not correct, its not based off recoveries. is there a better term for that?
- sqrt map scale shows 0s as pink. wtf? sqrt(0) = 0! actually this happens in various places, colorscale issue
- daily charts display pending, which may blow the domainMax, since we calculate it from max of total.
- ny data has some deltas <0, blowing the domainMin. why is that even happening?
- why are y and x axis in charts not evenly-spaced?
- no longer fixed header, and header padding wrong, after adding react-router
- setting daily w/ % doesn't display correctly
- isn't the hospitalized line misleading? is it cumulative or current?
- confirm all the withPlaces helpers are rounding off? thought some weren't
- confirm my "weighted per 1m" is statistically legitimate, or replace with whatever is best practice
- confirm i should be using per-1m not per-100k. i've seen elsewhere that per-100k may be more standard for low events?
- mouseover on map is triggering an entire render() everytime tooltip changes. dont do that.
- the state maps can be better rotated/projected, just not sure how. they are too curved as is.
- for the country also see if we can use a flat USA projection, like google maps
- #s for NYC are messed up. so i have to group the 5 counties of NYC as one region
- decide on if "confirmed" is the correct terminology rather than "positive"?
- change abs/absolute to 'tot' or 'total', i think thats clearer to the user.

REFACTOR
- CT data changed to add totalTestResults vs totals, deathIncrease, totalTestResults, use those.
- think about adding some kind of json cache
- switch to graphql interface
- investigate other chloropleth packages, including google-map-react, http://polymaps.org/
- use redux-toolkit: use configureStore
- consider redux-orm
- decide where CensusStore goes now
- rename remaining "entries" variables to "series"
- combine/trim jsons so less in browser processing for static files.
- have background task update static jsons when new data becomes available, instead of having in-browser do it
- is FIPS still the code i should be using? seems deprecated
- use route helpers if react-router has them? in map click handlers
- fix the damned sourcemaps
- get page to set body (or .app) classname like in ember
- submit bugfix to react-simple-maps to render *all* objects, not only the first GeometryCollection
