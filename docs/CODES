Old NIST standards (first number is standard, second number is version)
  FIPS 5-2: 1987, 2 digit numeric AND alpha code for each state, DC, territory
  FIPS 6-4: 1990, 3 digit numeric value for each county in a state
  FIPS 8-6: 1995, codes for MSA, µSA, CMSA, PMSA, and NECMA
  FIPS 9-1: 1995, congressional districts
  FIPS 10-4: 1994, two letter country codes
  FIPS 55-DC3: 1994: populated places, county divisions, locational entities

New INCITS standards (ANSI-accredited)
  - INCITS 38  – 2009 replaces FIPS 5-2 for state codes
  - INCITS 31  – 2009 replaces FIPS 6-4 for county codes
  - INCITS 454 - 2009 replaces FIPS 8-6
  - INCITS 455 - 2009 replaces FIPS 9-1
  - 10-4 not sure, I think USG is developing its own ISO 3166 standard
  - FIPS 55-DC3: ?

ISO 3166 standards (Geneva)
  - 3166-1 - countries and their subdivisions
    - alpha-2: two letter country codes, siilar to FIPS 10-4
    - alpha-3: three letter country codes
    - numeric: 3-digit country codes
  - 3166-2: 
  - 3166-3: codes for countries deleted from 3166-1, for example midway islands.

Notes:
- The combined 5 digit FIPS specifies a county exactly. I dont think this combination has its own standard or name
- Most census docs still use FIPS
- The "outlying islands" have a single 2 digit code
- "United States Minor Outlying Islands" is a ISO 3166-1 code. the US doesnt treat it as that.
- COFA countries have their own 2-digit codes
- EAS codes - additional 2-number codes by NOAA that supplement state codes
- NUTS codes - EU geo codes for mostly the EU territory
- 3166-1 clearly has political considerations
  - Lots of non-countries are in 3166-1, like falkland islands or palestine, and US OMI
  - Lots of independent countries are listed as non-independent. Taiwan is listed as "Taiwan, Province of China"
- So there's ISO, NIST, ANSI, INCITS, OMB, Open Geospatial Consortium, fgdc.gov and usgs.gov/census.gov which make no standards, yet has most of the hard information on codes.
