  - Indian Reservations
    - really not sure i think they're still counted as part of states?
  - Embassies abroad
  - ...but for our purposes, i think all the data rolls up into states, DC, or territories.

Freely Associated States (have usps codes, and we provide services to them, but they're in the UN)
  Palau                          - free associate (COFA)
  Marshall Islands               - free associate (COFA)

Definitions for territories
  - incorporated: congress extends full constitution to territory as it applies to the states
  - unincorporated: the constitution only partly applies to the territory
  - organized: have a territorial government established by congress through an organic act
  - unorganized: government not established by congress, but may still have government

Notes: 
  - PR, Guam, VI, AS, Mariana islands are the only territories with any real population.
  - Old Term: Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands: the COFA states + northern mariana islands
  - ISO 3166-2 is relevant
  - I still dont understand, *IS* there a difference between an insular area and a territory?
  - Insular areaa: atleast the State Dept. defines this as US territories + COFA free associates
