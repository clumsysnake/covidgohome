PSA
  - The OMB does not currently use the term Primary Statistical Area
  - its commonly used to identify the most extensive SA for a given county
  - I think this means

County & County Equivalents
  - ~3143 counties and county equivalents in states and DC
  - ~100 county equivalents in US territories
  - they are "admin2", second-level administrative divisions.
  - equivalents (usually just different historical names it seems)
    - Louisiana's parishes
    - Alaska's organized bouroughs
    - Alaska's Unorganized Borough comprises 11 census areas equivalent to counties
    - Virginia, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada have "independent cities"
    - American Samoa's districts and unorganized atolls
    - USVI has districts (2)

Notes:
  - the OMB likes the term "delineate". the files are "delineation files". afaik that just means
  grouping of county/county-equivalents
  - all the SAs ignore state lines, there are many cross-state SAs.
  - PR and DC participate in the SAs also. PR has 12 CBSAs and 3 CSAs
  - Afaik other territories have no SAs

Questions:
  - what is a Consolidated city-county? how can i represent that? i may need to for NYC
  - Counties sometimes fall into Metropolitan Division Codes, what are those?
  - what is a PCSA exactly? Primary Census statistical area?
  - how does the census "urban area" compare to the SAs? census tracts dont match with counties?
  - what is an "urban agglomeration"? again i think a census term
  - not everything in a SA is a county, it also might be a county equivalent! what are those?
  - also see these atleast in census.gov, what are the equivalents?
    - "state or statistical equvialent"
    - CBSA county or statistical equivalent
    - CBSA incorporated place that is legally independent of any county
  - can i reliably calc the population if each SA from county population? or is there a better way
  - is it correct to say i only need to worry about MSAs anyway.... all large CBSAs are MSAs?
  - just curious, is there any CSA with one CBSA, or any CBSA with one county/equivalent?
