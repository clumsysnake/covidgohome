per area:
	population
	density
	geojsons
	fips (if exists)
	tp
	children (areas it comprises)
	series (has 0-to-many frames)
		:time indexes
			date
			timestamp (of when data was released )
		:monotonic increasing, >=0, these describe counts of events
			collections (tests collected)
			positives
			negatives
			deaths
			recoveries
			admissions (admitted to hospital)
			icued (admitted to icu)
			ventilations (started ventilation on)
			*results (test results came back)
			*resolutions (recovery or death)
		:non-monotonic, >0, these describe events which begin and end
			onVentilator
			inHospital
			inIcu
			*active
			*pending

		**:deltas of monotonic, always >= 0
			positivesDelta
			negativesDelta
			admissionsDeltaa
			icuedDelta
			ventilationsDelta
			collectionsDelta
			resultsDelta
		**:deltas of non-monotonic (- or +)
			pendingDelta
			activeDelta
			onVentilatorDelta
			inHospitalDelta
			inIcuDelta
		**:rates have a calculation just for the current frame and also for period from 1st frame to current
			deathRate = deaths / positives (not true CFR, CFR so far)
			admissionRate = admissions / positives
			icuRate = ... icued / positives OR icued / admissions
			positiveRate = positives / results

* while these are fundamental fields, they are derivable via equation, and these are the least reported.
** all deltas and rates are derivable from initial 

- All deltas are assumed to be between two equivalently spaced frames
- attackrate = positives / population , this is an odd one, just positives scaled really..
- is there a "mild" category?

Terminology:
	- counts = monotonic values. they simply increment when an event occurs. test, negative, death, etc.
	- toggles = nonmonotonic values. 
	- metrics = union of counts and toggles

transforms:
	scale (per 1m, etc) : all toggles and counts scaled.
	squared: all togg
	delta percentage
	totals
	percentage scale (does this make sense?)

equalities and inequalities
	getting tested:
		collections = pending + results
		results = positives + negatives
	after diagnosis:
		resolutions = deaths + recoveries
		positives = actives + resolutions = actives + deaths + recoveries
	in hospital:
		inHospital > onVentilator + inICu
		inIcu > onVentilator (I think)
		positives > inHospital
